# Capstone Project - Create a React App
My final project during my Web Development Bootcamp was to create an App using React. I created a hangman game that showcases all the different skills and techniques I learned. There was certain criteria I had to follow; It had to contain different components that respond to user interaction, where a number of them were rendered using the array.Map() method. User interaction had to modify the state of some components - I utilised this by the hangman image changing state depending on whether the user selected a correct/incorrect letter. The user had to be able to request help where I explained the rules on a new "page using the react-router-dom. The app also had the be attractive, easy to use and intuitive.
